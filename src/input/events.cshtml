    <h1 class="card-title mb-1">A journey into NoSQL Databases with Azure Cosmos DB - Kaleb Pederson</h1>
    <h5 class="card-subtitle text-muted mb-2">January 9th, 2020</h5>

    <p>
      &ldquo;NoSQL&rdquo; technologies have been around for a long time but many of us still aren’t well versed in these
      technologies: document databases, graph databases, column databases, and key-value stores (wait, is that even a
      database?). In this talk we’ll take a look at the different types of NoSQL databases, what they’re used for, and
      the fundamental knowledge required to decide among them. We’ll then take a more focused look at the Azure Cosmos
      DB implementation of NoSQL databases with a heavier focus on its document database capabilities.

    <h2>About the Presenter</h2>

    <p>
      Kaleb Pederson is a professional programmer and software crafter with almost 20 years of professional development
      experience. He was first introduced to programming when he received a Radio Shack TRS-80 as a birthday present.
      Although his first attempts to learn programming were with BASIC and Pascal, his first real introduction to
      software development started in 1995 with a relational database programming project using an Alpha 5 database,
      which included a BASIC variant called X-Basic.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      After a brief stint studying engineering and mathematics, he diverted to Computer Science. Kaleb has a Master of
      Science degree in Computer Science from Eastern Washington University. Kaleb currently works at HealthEquity as a
      Software Architect where he focuses on tools and frameworks and continues to refine his skills as a software
      architect and crafter. He thoroughly enjoys all aspects of software development, from software design to
      functional programming or low-level performance tuning.

    <h1 class="card-title mb-1">Verify is Worth 1,000 Asserts - An Introduction to ApprovalTests.Net - Gary Ray</h1>
    <h5 class="card-subtitle text-muted mb-2">February 13th, 2020</h5>

    <p>
      When testing complex systems and objects, particularly in a legacy code base, you can find yourself writing a
      thousand Assert() statements to check the value of individual properties. What if you could write a single
      Verify() line that would validate the state of an entire complex object, or verify the full state of a View or
      Form? What if you could test the diff for a generated report or an image? That is the idea behind Approval Tests,
      a cross-platform and open source testing framework. The Approval Tests framework and related extensions are
      available on NuGet, and more information can be found at <a
      href="https://approvaltests.com/">https://approvaltests.com/</a>.

    <h2>About the Presenter</h2>

    <p>
      I am an IT Architect with the State of Utah. I've worked on everything from simple static websites to complex
      economic and statistical forecasting systems, and in any given week may find myself writing C#, Java, Python,
      JavaScript or VB.Net. My current focus is on legacy system modernization and agile coaching.
