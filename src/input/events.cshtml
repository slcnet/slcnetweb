    <h3>Keynote Description</h3>
    <p>Ah, the promises of Microservices. Small manageable services.
    Independent lifecycles. More features, faster, and with fewer regressions.
    Unlimited scale. Asynchronous messaging and eventual consistency bliss.
    Operational visibility, dashboards, and audit logs. Containers everywhere.
    It sounds fantastic right? And, it can be, for some. Will you be one of
    them? This session will contemplate how to survive this seductive approach
    toward solution architecture - with challenges in mind - and some
    reasoning as to why it's worth the effort.</p>
