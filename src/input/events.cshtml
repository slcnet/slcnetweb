    <h1 class="card-title mb-1">Polishing Your Unit Testing Code - Kevin Bost, Microsoft MVP</h1>
    <h5 class="card-subtitle text-muted mb-2">June 11, 2020</h5>

    <p>
      Effectively testing your code can be difficult. It can be even harder to
      do it well and ensure you are making the most effective use of precious
      development time. It can be enough to make us loose our marbles. In this
      presentation we will cover getting started writing tests, up through
      advanced techniques using test doubles and simulators. Along the way, we
      will look at some real-world examples where these techniques are being
      actively used.
