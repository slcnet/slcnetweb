    <h1 class="card-title mb-1">Modernizing an Existing System to Take a More Domain-Driven Approach - Bill Penberthy</h1>
    <h5 class="card-subtitle text-muted mb-2">Thursday, March 11th, 2021</h5>

    <p>Distributed computing and the cloud go hand-in-hand. However, there are a lot 
    of applications that are built in a more classic way that does not take into account 
    the cloud and what it offers. In this discussion we will talk about modernizing an 
    application or system. Weâ€™ll talk a bit about domain-driven design and several of 
    the more common design patterns used during a refactor. After the theory, we will 
    step into the realm of the practical and walk through the process of performing 
    changes on a large application.</p>
    
    <em>About the Speaker</em>

    <p>With over 25 years in software development (15+ of which is .NET), Dr. Bill 
    brings a pragmatic (curmudgeonly?) approach to software development. With much of 
    that time spent in consulting, he has worked on many different projects and used 
    many different designs and approaches. He recently switched to the dark side and 
    uses his development experience as a .NET developer advocate with AWS, helping AWS 
    to build a better and more rich .NET developer experience.</p>

    <h1 class="card-title mb-1">Best Practices for Sustainable Repos and Pipelines - Andrew Arnott</h1>
    <h5 class="card-subtitle text-muted mb-2">Thursday, June 10th, 2021</h5>

    <p>Starting a new repo or pipeline can be easy, but designing it for reliable and repeatable builds in the face 
    of network dependencies and SDK version updates across machines and time can be a worthy and challenging endeavor. 
    Come learn how to get started right so your repo and pipeline is stable, approachable and grows with you. We'll 
    focus on git, Azure Pipelines, and GitHub Actions. Touching lightly on AppVeyor/travis.ci. Pipeline focus is more 
    on CI than on CD.</p>
