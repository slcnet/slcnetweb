# Safety & Inclusion

*TL;DR Don't be a jerk or tolerate others being jerks.*

Although some would argue that more is better, our safety and inclusion policy
is very simple: everybody deserves to be treated respectfully and feel safe,
no matter what.

Anyone attending an SLC.NET event who is in violation of this policy will be
asked to leave and may be unwelcome to return to future events at the
discretion of the SLC.NET organizing board.
